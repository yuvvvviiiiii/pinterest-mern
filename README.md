Pinterest Clone
Project Overview
This project is a clone of the Pinterest platform, created using Express.js, MongoDB, Passport.js, Sessions, Mongoose.js and Multer. The primary goal of this project is to develop a fully functional backend with essential features like user authentication, image upload, and pin creation, while providing a front end that mirrors the original Pinterest design.

Features
User Authentication:
Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely.
Authentication is managed using Passport.js.
Pin Creation:

Images are uploaded using Multer and stored locally on the server.

Uploaded images are stored locally using Multer.
Database:
All user and pin data is stored in MongoDB.
Mongoose.js is used for interacting with the MongoDB database.
